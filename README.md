# About
monkeBLOCK is a simple pop-up and redirect blocker for Chromium-based browsers.
monkeBLOCK will block un-wanted pop-ups and redirects to untrustworthy* websites. A notification will appear alerting the user of the blocked URL, and give the user the choice to proceed or stay on the current webpage.
monkeBLOCK also provides users the ability to enable StrictMode, a mode which disables redirects and pop-ups to ALL and ANY URL, requiring the user to manually approve redirects.



*: monkeyBLOCK determines the trustworthiness of a URL using SSL Lab's ssl checker ("https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v3/analyze?host=URL"). Webpages with a poor SSL grade or lack of HTTPS will be blocked by default.

# DISCLAIMER
monkeBLOCK IS NOT A PERFECT POP-UP AND REDIRECT BLOCKER. IT SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A STANDALONE SECURE BROWSING TOOL. BY USING monkeBLOCK, ALL RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ON THE USER.
